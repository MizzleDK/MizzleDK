### Hi there 👋

Thanks for dropping by my profile. 👀

My name is Michell and I'm currently working as a staff Android engineer at [Public.com](https://www.public.com/). 🚀

I've been working with [Android](https://github.com/topics/android) development for many years now and I've had a few popular apps on Google Play, which have since been open sourced on GitHub. I sadly haven't been able to maintain them for several years now, but the source code may still be useful to some. I'm also proud that one of them - Mizuu - is included in the 2020 Arctic Code Vault project. ❄️

I love to write and I've done a few [Medium.com blog posts](https://medium.com/@michellbak) on Android development in the past. Hopefully I'll be able to do more of this in the future - fingers crossed! 🤞

To be continued... ✨
